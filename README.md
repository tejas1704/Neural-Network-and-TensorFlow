# Neural-Network-and-TensorFlow

  - Implemented Neural Network (forward pass and back propagation)  
  - Used validation set to tune hyper-parameters for Neural Network (number of units in the hidden layer and lambda)  
  - Evaluated this Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network's performance in classifying handwritten digits.  
  - Analyzed a more challenging dataset and compare the performance of the neural network against deep neural network using the TensorFlow library.  
    
For accuracy and confusion matrix see report.
